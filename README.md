## Qn.1
# JSX is an extension to JavaScript, making it easier for developers to write html in JavaScript files.
## Why it's used:
# Readability: JSX makes the code more readable and easier to understand.
# Component Structure: It allows developers to define the structure of components in a way that resembles HTML.
# JavaScript Integration: You can embed JavaScript expressions within JSX using curly braces {}.

## Qn.2
## Props:
# Props are inputs to components
# Used to pass data from one component to another, typically from a parent component to a child component.
# Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.

## State:
# Represents the internal data of a component.
# State can be changed and updated within the component, which can trigger re-renders.
# It is used to manage dynamic data that can change over time.

## Qn.3
# Hooks are special functions in React that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components to enable state management and lifecycle features without needing to convert functional components into class components.
